		<h3>
			Conducted by Rodrigo Chavez, Percussionist/ educator
		</h3>
		<hr/>
		<p>
			In the past 12 years CASSAVA has facilitated interactive drumming workshops 
			for the corporate sector with amazing results. The workshops are fun, conducted 
			in a “Drum Circle” format geared to produce better interaction and fluent communication 
			amongst the participants. This is a “hands-on” percussion workshop where participants are 
			all welcome in a safe and inclusive environment. No musical background is required but an 
			open mind would help to navigate the workshop even better. Historical and geographical notes 
			are part of the workshop when describing the origins of drumming, culture, countries and the
			characteristics of each style. Dancing and singing are the fun part of the program that can
			be produce in formats of 1 Hr., 2 Hrs. or 4 Hrs. intense workshops.

			Teaching Philosophy
		</h2>
		<p>
			In Toronto, I have been teaching and conducting workshops since 1984 of Afro-Latin music 
			and Native music of Central and South America. Before that, I studied classical guitar in 
			Buenos Aires, Argentina. I have traveled to Argentina, Cuba, Venezuela, Peru and Bolivia,
			seeking out masters of Native and Afro-Latin music to connect these traditions with my own 
			creative vision. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Currently, I am the Artistic Director of CASSAVA LATIN BAND, 
			composing contemporary Latino-Canadian music, exploring the rich variety of 
			Latin Rhythms and performing in different stages of Canada and USA. I also conduct 
			percussion workshops on Latin Music, presenting an ecological approach to sound and 
			environment, as part of an educational integrated arts program called Global Rhythms. 
			I present this work in different Boards of Education, performing yearly in many schools 
			and universities of Ontario. I constantly take part on a variety of other multi-disciplinary
			projects, with such companies as Angikam Dance Initiative classical Indian Kathak dance troupe,
			Esmeralda Enriquez, Flamenco Dance Company, recording for Kiran Ahluwalia Indo-Pakistani 
			Singer and Mediterraneo Greek Music Ensemble, directed by master bouzuky player Kostas 
			Apostolakis.

			I feel that the teaching of drumming, especially when drawing on the oral
			traditions and the techniques of ancient cultures, offers the students an 
			opening into an entirely new set of tools for their personal expression. 
			Students develop listening skills, respect for their instruments and themselves,
			and the mental discipline required to master complex Afro-Latin rhythms. They learn 
			how to interact with each other unselfishly and co-operatively. Each gains in self-esteem 
			as they create and perform music on their own instruments. The teachings give students a 
			fuller understanding not only of the music, but of the day-to-day reality of other cultures. 
			By playing the conga drums or the cowbells, for example -by becoming a part of that musical
			tradition- they learn about and gain an understanding of those cultures.
		</p>
		<p>
			My teaching philosophy is grounded in giving students tools for their own creation. 
			These tools open a window to an entirely new world of expression, a world that is both
