		<p>
		Cassava is a Latin Band based in <b>Toronto, CANADA</b> who performs musical 
		styles and rhythms from many areas of <b>Latin America</b>. The music reflects 
		the <b>colour and flavour</b> of traditional and contemporary Latin styles such as 
		Salsa, Bolero and Cha-cha-cha from Cuba, Bossa Nova and Samba from Brazil,
		Cumbia from Colombia, and contemporary Latin-Jazz. They also perform their 
		own original <b>vibrant compositions</b>.
		</p>

		<p>
		Cassava's colourful performances at festivals, clubs and special events 
		involve total audience participation and never fail to keep the crowd moving 
		to real Latin rhythms: “We make the whole audience participate and feel like
		part of the show”.

		the various styles”. We have been <b>very active with our program</b> through many concerts for the 
		Latin American and Canadian Community at large in Toronto and rest of Canada, including the 
		Maritimes and Quebec provinces through festivals and Cultural celebrations.
